## General info
Drop&Ship is an imaginary online clothing shop, offering an extensive range of garments to choose from. The website itself bears resemblance to your typical attire oriented one, consisting of a landing page, an info section and a browser with all of the items sorted by various categories. Upon choosing your desired product, add it to cart to buy it later (of course don't really buy it but simulate thus process). What's important about this project is that it is built with Next.js and the products' info are all stored in a remote database, and therefore it is a big step towards merging more backend and frontend technologies together.
